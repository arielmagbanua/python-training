Among the graduates were twin brothers, Dae-Ok Kim of the Energy, Environment, Water, and Sustainability (EEWS) Graduate School and Dae-Woo Kim of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, who received their doctorates on the same day.
The older brother, Dr. Dae-Ok Kim received both his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Master's degrees from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and later was admitted to the EEWS Graduate School for his doctorate. His dissertation was an "Investigation on the behaviors of gas molecules in water-filled nanopores: Applications to energy and environmental technology." Professor Huen Lee of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering was his faculty adviser. 
Dr. Dae-Ok Kim said, "It was a great advantage to conduct cooperative research with my brother by sharing information and discussing each other's fields." After graduating, Dr. Kim plans to research gas hydrates and porous materials at KAIST's Energy and Environmental Systems Lab for a year and to continue his research on applications in the United States.
