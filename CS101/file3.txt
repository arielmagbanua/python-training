The younger brother, Dr. Dae-Woo Kim received his B.S. from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and was admitted to the Master of Science-Ph.D. Integrated Degree Program in the same department. His doctoral thesis was on "Direct visualization of large-area domains of two dimensional materials by using optical birefringency." His faculty adviser was Professor Hee Tae Jung of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
Dr. Dae-Woo Kim said, "During my time at the graduate school, I could overcome my difficulties by talking frankly to my brother. Our relationship deepened as we reached our academic goals together at KAIST."
Dr. Dae-Woo Kim, who published more than 25 papers in international journals such as Nature and Nanotechnology, received the Silver Prize in the Human Tech Paper Awards sponsored by Samsung Electronics Corp. in 2011. After graduating, Dr. Kim will research graphene and 2D material structure control at KAIST's Organic Opto-Electronic Materials Lab for a year and take up further research on their applications in the United States.
